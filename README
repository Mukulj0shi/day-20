Comprehensions:
Comprehensions are used to write single line of code for creating list, dictionaries and sets.

List comprehension reduces the number of line of code.
For example: We have to create a list of 10 items.
>>> list1
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


list1 = []
for i in range(0, 10):
    list1.append(i)

above 3 line of code can be written in single line using list comprehensions.
list2 = [x for x in range(0, 10)]

Lambda Function: 
A small function that can take any number of arguments, but we don't need to write a return to give a value.

example
Here lambda function return the sum of two arguments a and b.
x = lambda a,b,c : a + b * c

In this example calling lambda function needs three argument.
x(2,3,6)

If we put only 2 arguments we will get a TypeError:
"TypeError: <lambda>() missing 1 required positional argument: 'c'"
