List Comprehensions:
Creating list of items using a single line of for loop.
List comprehension reduces the number of line of code.
For example: We have to create a list of 10 items.
>>> list1
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


list1 = []
for i in range(0, 10):
    list1.append(i)

above 3 line of code can be written in single line using list comprehensions.
list2 = [x for x in range(0, 10)]
